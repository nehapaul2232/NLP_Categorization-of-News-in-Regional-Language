# Categorization-of-News-in-Regional-Language

With huge amounts of unclassified news, people often find it difficult to search for a specific
news headline and read it. Therefore, the aim of this project is to build a simple neural network
model to classify news headlines in a regional language into different categories namely - sports,
cinema, world news, etc. It is to be noted that no proper system or application exists for regional
languages such as Tamil, Telugu, Hindi etc. making it difficult for people searching for a
particular category. In our project text classification will be performed on news headlines using
BI-GRU (Bidirectional gated recurrent unit) and LSTM. In order to build the model, the dataset will be tokenized followed by feature extraction and classification. It serves the
purpose of classifying different types of Tamil and Telugu newspaper headlines into specific
categories.
